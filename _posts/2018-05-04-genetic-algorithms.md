title: Optimization with Genetic Agorithms is now released
---

The optimization by means of Genetic Algorithms is now part of the main repository. It can be used by anyone along with the classic semi-automatic calibration method. 

To know more about the optimization of the analog method by means of Genetic Algorithms, you can check these two articles:
